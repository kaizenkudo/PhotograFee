<p class ="pf">PhotograFee is a 12-man team consisting of passionate people striving to make the world a fair place for artists by getting their crafts and talents acknowledged. The team does this by providing an open platform like PhotograFee where artists, specifically photographers, have a place to display their works and get them regarded by potential clients who will pay for their service. 
<br>
<br>
This platform started as a simple project for the team's Web Systems Technology course which was conducted in 2021. Now, PhotograFee has over 1,000,000 million photographers supported and 5,000,000 million clients satisfied. Thank you for your relentless support of our movement!
